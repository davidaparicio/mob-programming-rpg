# Goal

- For next time we could take a look at this one:
    - Game ctor should use props obj iso multi params

# Retro

## How did that feel?
- Super fun
- Learned a lot
- Super Excited to have Austin +1
- Exploratory
- Very quick and smooth onboarding and getting into details

## What worked well, we want to do more of it?
- first time using GitPod - pretty seemless
- feels like we're on the verge of getting the change done
- good learning moment about props
