# Goal

- curios to test the rotation issue again manually
    - fix failing ci (test)
        - hard-coded path to npm in the test
    - deploy to heroku (automatically)
- Game ctor should use props obj iso multi params
- !! potential bug: rotate button should not use rotateToTarget
- !! remove old and then unused rotate functions
- automate committing WITH coauthors. for example: create a script to commit with given co-authors, and then use it all the time
    - gitpod should be able to get the co-authors from github api
- create a GitHub issue on gitpod - "follow" another user on https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues
