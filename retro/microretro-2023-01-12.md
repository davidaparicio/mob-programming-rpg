# Goal
- Bug: Game ID should be in the URL
- Exploratory testing
    - A: which part? Q: all the app
    - run the app
- Tests start too fast (should wait a sec)
- Need another Service to host the wsserver
- How the URL looks like in a deployed 

# Agreements
- All Findings first?
    - 

# Findings 
- Game ID should be in the URL - this is blocking us from testing the game in multi-player mode
 - It works on the deployed enviroment (http://gregorriegler.com/mob-programming-rpg/pgh1xavnrx8), but not in our testing 
   environment (https://3000-gregorriegl-mobprogramm-dvv8izva1zo.ws-eu82.gitpod.io/)
- Allow the roles to be configurable (the ones shown in the "Help" page)
