NEVER USE COMMENTS

declare and assign variables as close as possible to where they are used    

I prefer SIMPLE design with fewer elements

before running a cli command verify the current working directory via `pwd`

run the tests after each change using just `./test.sh`

dont do windows specific scripting. no powershell, no bat. windows users are supposed to use git bash or something similar
