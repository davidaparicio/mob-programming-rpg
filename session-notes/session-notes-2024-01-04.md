Ideas for this session

- find the template by typing "template"
- prune the backlog / simplify the markdown files - how to get started with a session; make it easier to navigate into the session
  - we actually have two backlogs: 1. for the RPG game 2. the things we're interested in doing as a team
- clean-up the YYYY-MM-DD from the newly generated session notes
- we could first do a kata - code in the beginning

Agenda - today proposal

- [x] bonding
- [ ] get the .md files in shape - timeboxed to 25 min
- [ ] condensed coding
- [ ] backlog refinement

Agenda - Ideal

- bonding
- short decisions / review reminders
- get to coding quickly on a kata or other well refined backlog item
- mid-session retro
- more coding
- 10m retro
- backlog refinement
- improving process (e.g. the .md files)
- final longer retro

# Agenda

## Bond (15 min.)

-   Try a [warmup exercise](../docs/warmup-exercises.md)

## Work the Backlog (75 min.)

-   Consider checking the recent `git log -p`
-   Check the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Leave Breadcrumbs (5 min.)

-   Update the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Reflect / Retro (25 min.)

### How did that feel?

### What worked well, we want to do more of it?

### Ideas

-   Consider creating a backlog item if the idea is something we want to implement in a future mobbing session in [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)
    for an idea (that was generated at this retro).
