# How did that feel?
- I like working on Testinfrastructure
    - Nice engineering challenge
    - "What is a good way to test that"
    - Not sure if we found the best way
    - Maybe without browser would be better
- want to see them talk to each other in the test now
- async testing is always tricky
- distributed state is tricky
- promises help with the asyncness
- it was cool that jest takes care of timing out
- interresting idea to check for stderr too
- swift rotations -> really enable short timers
- i like 3 min timer
- I like that we keep working on it
- amazing we got something done in this short time

# What worked well, we want to do more of it?
- try it manually to make it simpler
- everybody had their screen already shared
- rotate even on broken state
- 3 min timer

# Idea
- An integration test including a live ws server and multiple ui components
- Invite people to join this
    - Screenshot with our faces and gather
    - Put it in Contributing.md
    - post on social media
