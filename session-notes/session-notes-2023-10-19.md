# Notes

Because there was a brand new participant, Joel and Nitsan created a session for the Roman Numberal kata using go.

The retro notes were also captured there in `retro.md`, and also pasted below

# Retrospective

## How did that feel?
- Great - We had some very good mutual understandings 
    - TDD, respecting strong-style pairing, working in small steps (immediately, no friction)
    - Seamlessly added late joiner in rotation (smooth)
    - Got me curious & engaged how the kata will turn out
    - Love having new people
- Great - Didn't feel interrupting
    - Small things kept us on task, e.g., chose not to do something (so could stay focused)
    - Valuable learning opportunity off-task
- Felt really relaxing and smooth
- Appreciate the environment: cyber dojo, simple kata, mob timer
    - allows to focus on the fundamentals
    - get warmed up before running a sprint
    - keeping things simple - supporting the team, new joiners, late comers
    - as few challenges at a time as possible

## What was so awesome we want to do it again / more of it?


## What experiments / changes might we want to try?
- Sometimes: Try taking refactoring step to the extreme before going to next failing test
