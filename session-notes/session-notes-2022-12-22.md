# Session Date: 2022-12-22
# Goal

- [X] !! potential bug: rotate button should not use rotateToTarget
- [X] !! remove old and then unused rotate functions
- For next time we could take a look at this one:
    - Game ctor should use props obj iso multi params

# Retro

## How did that feel?
- Glad I could join even though not planned
- Nice to connect
- Focused
- Surprised and happy that Nitsan joined (unplanned)
- Glad we got something done very quickly, felt productive

## What worked well, we want to do more of it?
- Communication is pretty easy +1 - flowing, and feels natural
- Strategy was good:
    - manual check - bug reproduced
    - fixing a bug test-first
    - "is there a test for this?"
    - found the relevant test, which was not performing correctly
    - fixed the test (was not testing well)
    - test became red
    - fixed the code
    - test became green
    - manual check - bug fix approved
    - clean-up the code - remove unsued
- also - it was very efficient - took only about 30m from start to end

## Idea
- Shachar from Mobus Operandi suggested to add the event to his dashboard
