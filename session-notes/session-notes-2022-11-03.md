# How did that feel?
- Enjoyed it, a bit of small talk in the beggining
- Felt productive, made good progress
- More comfortable with typing with the new keyboard
- Felt better with the pairing then usually, something with the pace maybe
- Relieved, when we played around with the UI and it actually worked
- Design could be tighter Form-Submit vs Toggle

# What worked well, we want to do more of it?
- testing how often a spy was invoked uncovered a bug
- quick experiments with tests
- Manual testing in the end, to increase confidence
- Make toggle idempotent (now two behaviors), without exposing internal design details

# Idea
- Use coverage tooling to find lines executed too often
