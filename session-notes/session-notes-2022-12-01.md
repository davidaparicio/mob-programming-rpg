# How did that feel?
- Challenging +100
- Not Stable, constantly port in use
- Should have tackled the need to rerun test earlier
- In control (to some degree)
- Got creative in testing +1
- Glad we could reproduce the bug, finally +1
- Tired in the beginning, now I'm full awoke again.

# What worked well, we want to do more of it?
- Trying to make small steps 
- Good Feedback from the logs of the ws server
- Tooling
- Rotations (2 mins)

# Idea
- Intention: Could reproduce the "too many rotations" Test, need to get rid of the log warns caused by not using "act". And find out why it mostly shows 4 rotations (we expected 2)
- Use Approvals with the server log
