# Agenda

- [x] **Bond:** Bonding
- [x] **Facilitator:** Identify who facilitates
- [x] **Co-Authors:** Update the [Co-Authors](#co-authors) 
- [x] **Welcome Newcomers:** If we have any newcomers review our [onboarding notes](../docs/onboarding-notes.md)
- [x] **Code:** Get to coding quickly on a kata or other well refined backlog item
  - [x] Everyone: turn on mob timer sounds ðŸ“£
  - [x] Add 'Retro' as the last participant to the timer 
  - [x] Code
  - [x] 1m/person mid-session retro
  - [x] More code (optional/consider refining backlog)
  - [x] 1m/person retro
- [ ] **Process improvement:** Improving process (e.g. the .md files) 
  - [ ] Maybe Consider what "ready" means for non-kata backlog items
  - The process is defined by the [template](./session-notes-YYYY-MM-DD.md)
- [ ] **Backlog refinement**
    - Backlog ideas:
      - Commit message generator
      - Lift Ticket Kata - refactor the hell out of it (RTHOOI)
      - Kata-fy and start in cyber-dojo and then migrate to other dev env (VSCode or pycharm etc)
        - commit message generator (kata)
        - mobtimer (kata)
        - other
      - JQ for Cyber-dojo
      - Teach GPT to refactor, e.g., inline var, extract method, etc. 
    - Process / practice ideas:
      - MobRPG game - practice roles

- [ ] **Retro:** Final longer retro

## Retro [Templates](../docs/retro-templates.md)

we were working here: https://cyber-dojo.org/kata/edit/wHkyGJ

Round #1

Joel:    Like the idea of getting going quickly - start with a generate state, and focus on refactoring
         Rotation are good and smooth
         Potential discussion: did we need a facilitator or not?

Nitsan:  Missed opportunity to have more challenging coding if we just used what GPT gave us

Michael: Go with the offer vs refine the offer; e.g. Nitsan suggests somthg, Michael & Joel suggested refinement - is it worth it?
         Same with the generated code from GPT - flow vs. quality


Round #2

Joel:    Liked Michael bringing up: "how do you break in while the Talker/Typer pair are talking?";
         Though: "are you open to a suggestion?"
         
Nitsan:  Liked that we've gone far in the kata. We started with working code and tests from GPT, which made
         it quick; and we are quick as developers with python, environment, etc. - good progress

Michael: Thanks for being ok with the suggestion.
         Prefer 'Add' to 'Instead'. Sometimes makes sense to stop and talk it through, back to dancing later. 
         Nitsan suggested a refactoring - just went with it. Done.
         

Round #3

Michael: As Joel was talking, trying not to lead from Typing position, also trying to anticipate where it was going; anticipated wrong.
         Sometimes you do anticipate right - feels good :)

Gregor:  Good example of: not caring what the code does, and just by looking at the structure able to make progress.
         Love it!

Joel:    Love it too, more time coding, and TDD. Coding + TDD - always loving it.
         Glad we tried backlog refinement, even if we couldn't figure it out;
         Talker / Typer flow - went pretty well. Sometimes as the Typer we should wait for the Talker to actually want something.

Nitsan:  Appreciated refactorings. Some were new to me, new sequence; was safe, small steps. Would like to continue this kata refactoring.
         Nice micro-steps

Round #4

Michael: Truting the collective mind. Learning + Explaning + Doing. Not a simple Talker / Typer strict pair.
         When dangerous - not doign more than asked.

Gregor:  Want to continue.

Joel:    Interesting. Taking a different direction for FizzBuzz. Learned: return a function in python.
         Noticed it's taking longer than expected, surprised.

Nitsan:  Interesting place to stop for a retro, in the middle of a thought. Steps are small and safe, but direction isn't clear to team - 
         How could we make this clearer?

Round #5

Michael: Reminding me of the Clojure exercise (isDivibleBy, then currying, and HOF). "Feel" the solution but not "know" it.
         At the edge of understanding -> learning is happening.
        
Gregor:  Interesting. Reminds me of a deep dive in fn programming, theory, typescript. Unary functions (taking single arg, return   
         single result) allow to use helper functions like `combine`.

Joel:    Interesting, and different way of thinking. E.g. a function returning a function.
         Like: separate out the data (3, fizz).
        
Nitsan:  Maybe I was too pushy about this refactoring idea; thanks for being patient with it. There are other ways to separate the data.
