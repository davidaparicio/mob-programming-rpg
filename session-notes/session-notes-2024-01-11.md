# Agenda

- [x] **Bond:** Bonding
- [x] **Facilitator:** Identify who facilitates
- [x] **Co-Authors:** Update the [Co-Authors](#co-authors) 
- [x] **Welcome Newcomers:** If we have any newcomers review our [onboarding notes](../docs/onboarding-notes.md)
- [ ] **Code:** Get to coding quickly on a kata or other well refined backlog item
  - [ ] Everyone: turn on mob timer sounds ðŸ“£
  - [ ] Add 'Retro' as the last participant to the timer 
  - [ ] Code
  - [ ] 1m/person mid-session retro
  - [ ] More code (optional/consider refining backlog)
  - [ ] 1m/person retro
- [ ] **Process improvement:** Improving process (e.g. the .md files) 
  - [ ] Maybe Consider what "ready" means for non-kata backlog items
  - The process is defined by the [template](./session-notes-YYYY-MM-DD.md)
- [ ] **Backlog refinement**
- [ ] **Retro:** Final longer retro

Round #1

Joel:    Like the idea of getting going quickly - start with a generate state, and focus on refactoring
         Rotation are good and smooth
         Potential discussion: did we need a facilitator or not?

Nitsan:  Missed opportunity to have more challenging coding if we just used what GPT gave us

Michael: Go with the offer vs refine the offer; e.g. Nitsan suggests somthg, Michael & Joel suggested refinement - is it worth it?
         Same with the generated code from GPT - flow vs. quality


Round #2

Joel:    Liked Michael bringing up: "how do you break in while the Talker/Typer pair are talking?";
         Though: "are you open to a suggestion?"
         
Nitsan:  Liked that we've gone far in the kata. We started with working code and tests from GPT, which made
         it quick; and we are quick as developers with python, environment, etc. - good progress

Michael: Thanks for being ok with the suggestion.
         Prefer 'Add' to 'Instead'. Sometimes makes sense to stop and talk it through, back to dancing later. 
         Nitsan suggested a refactoring - just went with it. Done.
