### Retro #1

5-minues, popcorn style!

What's important for the very next coding round?

Looking vs. not looking at the code
 - was a good learning experience
 - also was surprised by it
 - went with it
 - +1

Michael facilitating +1
- trying something new - try it, you will know if you like it or not
- not familiar with pytest+approvals - eiger to learn more
- glad to slow down for exaplanation

- Like writing the prompt into a shared location before we submit it to chat!

- Record? - yes
    - Primarily for own usage

- +1 D clearly stating the overall intention of this coding round
- Happy joining, and direclty getting into the rotation

### Retro #2

Diana: Consider changing IDE & testing framework; not doing approval tests.

Nitsan: Too much information. We created a lot of failing tests. 

Gregor: Not easy to follow. What's the goal?

Nitsan: Goal is to have AI generate the code as a start. 
We have 2 implementations now, so can  just take the best.
The refined prompt worked better.

Gregor: Test framework change would be better - all tests in one file. GPT doesn't generate approved files. 

Joel: Likes having a facilitator and deferring by default to the facilitator (similar to deferring to talker) - helps things keep moving. Could use a different testing framework, e.g., Cucumber.
