## Agenda

- [x] HH:00 **Bond:** Bonding
- [x] **Facilitator:** Identify who facilitates
- [ ] **Time-Keeper:** Identify who keeps track of total time for session
- [x] **Co-Authors:** Update the [Co-Authors](#co-authors) 
- [x] **Welcome Newcomers:** If we have any newcomers review our [onboarding notes](../docs/onboarding-notes.md)
- [ ] HH:25 **Decide on What to Code** by 25 min after the hour; choose either:
    - continuing kata 
    - new kata
    - well refined backlog item
    - new item - "follow the energy" - something else that can be coded by the mob 
- [ ] HH:30 **Code:** Get to coding by 30 min after the hour 
  - [x] Everyone: turn on mob timer sounds ðŸ“£
  - [x] Add "Retro" as the last participant in the timer
  - [ ] Code
  - [ ] 10m mid-session retro
  - [ ] More code
  - [ ] 10m retro
- [ ] **Process improvement:** Improving process (e.g. the .md files)
  - The process is defined by the [template](./session-notes-YYYY-MM-DD.md)
- [ ] **Backlog refinement**
- [ ] **Retro:** Final longer retro (consider: aim to start 30 min before end time)
- [ ] Done by end of 3 hour (consider: aim to finish 10 min early)

Retro Notes go here:

### Mid-Session Retro 1 (1 minute per person - what liked/disliked & propose changes)

Diana
- Loved this, fulfilling my needs; feel honored to get to choose what we did today; it was what I wanted
- I would save the links to the AI chats in cyber-dojo or gitpod session notes

Gregor
- I liked this idea - coding with GPT.
- Opinion - you can tackle anything this way (with GPT); have faith you will understand.

Nitsan
- Surprised by last prompt; results were great. New test looks more promising. Like a rachet
- Asked about Bing.com chat access. Answer: free for all, running GPT-4

Joel
- Find it interesting
- Liked - asked to make the method -> let's do both the test and the production code
- a bit more complicated due to the new language - Perl
- Like - to keep going this way

### Mid-Session Retro 2 (1 minute per person - what liked/disliked & propose changes)

Nitsan
- Got to red using a mutation; prompt to Chat wasn't clear enough (it didn't know "mutation"), so it refactored. 
  - We need to be more precise with Chat as to what we mean by mutation or refactoring. (Say what we mean by the terms.)

Gregor
- Surprised you needed the number of test cases (in perl) and that it added value for someone; happy to try it out

Joel
- Like: Gregor made sure that the test would fail using mutation testing
- going forward would like to go through Red before Green

### Final Retro

Gregor
- Liked the responses from ChatGPT; e.g. coming up with a new design to work with existing design - seems very good at these simple problems
- Worked well - we kept copy-pasting, 
- As long as the context is small, it works well - puts boundaries on how large we can go with the modules we work with
- Prompts: Use simple language and ask for short answers. Maybe can be simpler.

Joel
- Liked - helped to have the production code and tests in the same file - for GPT
- Liked - The mob pushed GPT until satisfied
- Liked - finding our way in terms of hand-over, even with prompts; we keep adjusting how we do that

Nitsan
- It's gotten much smoother - handling responses from GPT, the output, the code. Each of us has our own context with GPT, but it doesn't matter because our questions are focused. It still flows. We have matured in terms of realizing the chats with AI are ephemeral, just ask (no need to save the response; you can always ask again). This makes for smooth handovers in the mob (if not too attached to a particular convo with Chat).

Questions:
- Did we learn a bit of Pearl today? Was Chat helpful or destructive for the learning process? Was it too easy to get any answer from Chat?
- Some answers/thoughts: 
  - It was useful, was motivating, easy to get to success, motion/progress, learning from it; not remembering all the details since didn't need to; good starting point. Analogy: kids who play with calculators may learn to do math by hand faster than otherwise.

Ideas:
- We could have Chat quiz us on the code we've been working on.
- We could review the code after, and ask GPT questions about it if we don't understand.
- Make sure to ask GPT to refactor with each TDD cycle, and consider making sure we as humans understand what it's giving us, in case we don't agree with the refactoring or don't think it goes far enough in the refactoring.
