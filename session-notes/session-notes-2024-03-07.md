Retro Notes go here:

### Mid-Session Retro 1 (1 minute per person - what liked/disliked & propose changes)


Joel
- Liked - "let's do TDD" - helping each other when forgetting
- hello world - testing the test system - a more precise name vs. testing fizzbuzz
- Liked - getting the cyber-dojo quickly, in the background - updting the gitpod

Diana
- Liked - at 20m after start time, having code running
- Liked - sharing the screen, starting cyber-dojo - getting into the shared context
- Liked - feels safe not to know, to not have the screen work correctly

Gregor
- good to be back! thanks for wuickly starting something
- love double-loop
- Q: double looping, started from outside; is it ok to have the first test pass w/o a running program?

Nitsan
- thesting hello world vs testing our instance of fizz buzz
- we do not have a program
- CHANGE. fizzbuzz should be an actual program and we should test it more from the outside
- we can explore.

### Mid-Session Retro 2 (1 minute per person - what liked/disliked & propose changes)

Diana
- Love the fact that changing the approach to fizzbuzz, makes it confusing all of the sudden
- Helpful asking "what is your intention?", could phrase it just enough to pass it forward
- Being a verbal thinker - by answering a Q, helps me discover what am thinking

Joel
- Enjoyed it, nice flow
- improve - have timer sound
- trying to capture the output from separate program, but deffered to keep the focus, and the steps small
- Liked: code is now cleaner, working with refactoring, removing clutter helps us focus

Gregor
- Enjoyed wroking together! We understand each other, how we would approach things, feels comfortable
- Wish - should have asked on what was the high level intent for the `first_line` variable

nitsan
- good points in this retro
- one min pers person retro
 - people are veery insightful and conveying a lot
 -  Gregor:  I wish I could have asked about the intention
 - I learn about how to hand over something clearly,
 - could have stoppped and not do anytyhing
 - the first test:  test the first line of the program
 - make it clear that we are only asserting on the first line
 - very small difference:  1 vs 1\n
 - the assertion tests the whole output of the program
 - have the test, test. what it says
 - change the test to what it affects the test
 - WRITE test before code, write the name of the test before the code
 - the name should tell me whjat the test is trying to do
