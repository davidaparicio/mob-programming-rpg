Retro Notes go here:

### Mid-Session Retro 1 (1 minute per person - what liked/disliked & propose changes)

Diana
- Love the intention - suport each other in learning
- Want to understand the code
  - Idea - read the README +1
  - Also - Curious about how we might read the code to understand
- Excited about maybe using pytest at work

Joel
- Going fast doing the setup - a bit disequilebrating(?!)
  - Idea - Maybe we could have a script / document to automate this
- Appreciate the group!

Nate
- Little Nate is proud! Able to contribute, even when thought I couldn't when being a Speaker!
- Following along, getting some of the steps but not all; got it done in the end, not fully understading; Forgiving of that
- A little overwhelmed

Nitsan
- sorry for going to fast for the set up
I just remeembered and went rhough them 
the steps are in the readme

I like how we work together
+1 look at the read me for better understanding of the kata before going forward


### Mid-Session Retro 2 (1 minute per person - what liked/disliked & propose changes)

Diana
- Going really well.
- Seems like we're on the right path to practice testing with relevant patterns
- Same kata two weeks in a row - getting better at starting it
- Remember to commit!

Joel
- Like how we went about deciding what to do next - a few ideas
- Enjoyable; Fun to figure out how to test old code, where to start
- Having a specific test for a new requirement feels good

Nate
- Like: "downloads", super fast learning
- Dislike: in between difficult to stay focused, trying not to distract the group

Nitsan
- Curious how this will turn out 
- We have a test and need to see if we can get it to pass without touching the existing code
- Consider 4 minutes per turn, or keep at 3 minutes
