# Agenda

## Bond (30 min.)

-   Try a [warmup exercise](../docs/warmup-exercises.md)

## Do ?
FizzBuzz in Clojure
https://cyber-dojo.org/kata/edit/EtbGU6


## Mid Session Retro (10 min.)
Tips: 
- TRY FOR 10 MIN. LIMIT. HAVE A HELPER ALSO TIME. AT END OF TIME, VOTE TO EXTEND IF NEEDED ONLY
- Remember "Kindness, consideration and respect" - assume good intent; everyone is doing the best they can 

How did that feel (1-2 words / 30 sec)?
- frustrating, fulfilling, overwhelmed
- exciting, playful
- curious, scared, fulfilled
- rocky, relieved
- resfreshing, collaborative

What did you like so much you want to do more of it / do it again?
- clojure
- everybody involved
- observation doing thinking for another person
- practicing thinking out loud +1
- Nn8 doing like a pro:
  - I feel overwhelmed
  - Modeled being honest and verbalizing where he was and what he was thinking.
  - Stream of thought
- Modeling how we can get off track and on track
- Copying an old test case to create a new one

What might you want to try differently / experiment?
- Remind newcomers to enter their author info (eg. Co-Authored-By: Blaise Pabon <blaise@gmail.com>)

## Do ?
Continue FizzBuzz in Clojure
https://cyber-dojo.org/kata/edit/EtbGU6

# 2nd Retro (END OF SESSION)

What to do next? Vote on Proposals:
- Proposals:
    - 1. spending less time deciding on what we're doing (more time coding)
    - 2. shared leadership, dedicated facilitation
    - 3. consider a checklist for newcomers (was a discussion about this)
    - 4. consider items in the backlog (reminders, what are we working on, etc.)
