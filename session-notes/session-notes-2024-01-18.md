### mini Retro

Michael:
better to reflect on code changes before doing more code changes

Gregor:
like to do more, we could have gotten to code quicker, 
we could have done everything we did before hand, in the mob
given we only had one full rotation
 I like to go in and TRUST the process. 

 Joel: 
 liked thte things that we did
  it was interesting to try the refactoring at the same time
   i like we were refactoring towards something differnt
    there were a lot of convoluted pathways
    re: process: we starte at 45 min rather than 30 min after
    as a default: say we will keep going
    
Diana:
Fine, still started coding faster than in the past.
Interesting convo at start.
Love using GPT, curious about prompts, like seeing the prompts people come up with.
  Would like to capture the prompts in some way.
