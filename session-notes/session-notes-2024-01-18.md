- [x] **Welcome Newcomers:** If we have any newcomers review our [onboarding notes](../docs/onboarding-notes.md)
- [ ] **Code:** Get to coding quickly on a kata or other well refined backlog item

    - Resume last week's kata

    - For THIS week
      - Refactor heck out of new GPT generated solution
         - fizzbuzz

  - [x] Everyone: turn on mob timer sounds ðŸ“£
  - [x] Add 'Retro' as the last participant to the timer 
  - [x] Code
  - [x] 1m/person mid-session retro
  - [x] More code
  - [x] 1m/person retro
- [ ] **Process improvement:** Improving process (e.g. the .md files)
  - The process is defined by the [template](./session-notes-YYYY-MM-DD.md)
- [ ] **Backlog refinement**
- [ ] **Retro:** Final longer retro

## Retro [Templates](../docs/retro-templates.md)

### mini Retro 1

Michael:
better to reflect on code changes before doing more code changes

Gregor:
like to do more, we could have gotten to code quicker, 
we could have done everything we did before hand, in the mob
given we only had one full rotation
 I like to go in and TRUST the process. 

 Joel: 
 liked thte things that we did
  it was interesting to try the refactoring at the same time
   i like we were refactoring towards something differnt
    there were a lot of convoluted pathways
    re: process: we starte at 45 min rather than 30 min after
    as a default: say we will keep going
    
Diana:
Fine, still started coding faster than in the past.
Interesting convo at start.
Love using GPT, curious about prompts, like seeing the prompts people come up with.
  Would like to capture the prompts in some way.

### mini Retro 2

Diana:
Wondering about how Michael was feeling when we weren't getting to coding as fast as wanted after 1st retro?
(Answer from Michael: Frusted. 18 minutes total instead of 1 min. each.)
Really happy to be here.

Michael:
Liked that able to practice expressing emotions/frustration. 
Would like to stick to mid-retro 1 min. limit person. 

Gregor:
Happy to have Diana back with us.
Like doing small steps.
Like the process now: we can raise what's important to us every rotation & can keep going so doesn't feel too disruptive

Joel:
Slow down a little to expain process to newcomer or someone who hasn't been here for a while. (Temporary slow down only)

### longer retro

Gregor:
We were testing our agenda and session notes with Diana who hadn't been here for this agenda before. 
Diana seemed like a faciltator.

We also discussed:
Being explicit about what we need, how verbose to be, when to do just-in-time vs up front explaining / setting up / helping newcomers,
consider letting people try/flounder and hold back on helping (give them time to try).

From Diana:
- Consider: add to retro notes----> for mid session retro be committed to the outcome rather than committed to the process
- liked it Worked well
  not a alot to make it better
  since agenda was not explicit
  we might need to allow time for onboard someone unfamiliar
â€”- pattern Diana has
Verbose about what I need 
Michael: As an engineer I try to problems and fix. As a sales person  I try to find things that work and sell them.
Fat finger fumbling 


How to get faster to coding. Proposal(s):
- Do the first idea in room unless someone else disagrees and wants to do someone else
- Keep doing what is WIP until done/exhausted
- Lean coffee... time box, don't debate a long time

### How we spent our time today:
- 36 minutes coding
- 45 minutes template edits (?)
- H1:00 - H0:18 bonding            (18 min)
- H1:18 - H1:45 agenda & deciding  (37 min)
- H1:45 - H2:05 round 1 of coding  (20 min)
- H2:05 - H2:20 min-retro          (15 min)
- H2:20 - H2:36 round 2 of coding  (16 min)
- H2:36 - H3:00 retro              (24 min)
- H3:00 - H:30 process improvement (30 min)
- Thoughts:
  - Gregor: Too much time on deciding, but overall fine
  - Michael: Reasonable, but not as much coding (only 20%)
  - Joel: More coding would be better! Time-box deciding or keep going (instead of changing what work on) more often
