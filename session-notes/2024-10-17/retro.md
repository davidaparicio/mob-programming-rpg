Chat workflow

Michael

- a great exercise
- distinguishing between two things we're editing:
  - spec / prompt
- the markdown is the source, the chat is the code generator - like source and compiler
- we're now meat robots for the artificial intellignce,
  we should automate ourselves out of this loop
- full spec vs. incremental spec

Diana

- Enjoyed this practice
- bad connection / bad audio - makes things harder
- workflow worked great: having one dedicated "gpt-runner"
- full round trip of code generation: if you change the code it doesnt come back in...

Instead of you having to copy and paste
Reference the file and then tool will insert the updated code into the prompt

I built the tool typist tool 
As a pipeline of components
And you can pick and shoes which parts to use

The expand component

It expands files, and it also expands 

The 
It can use a diff tool 
So you can see the changes and MAKE the choice of where to apprive or discard
