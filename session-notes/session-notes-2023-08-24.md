# Agenda

## Bond (15 min.)

-   Try a [warmup exercise](../docs/warmup-exercises.md)

## Work the Backlog (75 min.)

-   Consider checking the recent `git log -p`
-   Check the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Leave Breadcrumbs (5 min.)

-   Update the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Reflect / Retro (25 min.)

### How did that feel?

- It was a Joy
- I love todays session
- It was cool, the combination of brainstorming to leverage chatGPT and to automation
- I would like to see more of this (AI Assisted Programming)

### What worked well, we want to do more of it?

- There was something about rotations I noticed:
  - We're going Typing -> Talking -> Next.
  - I was hungry going to get something to eat, and when I came back I only had to type. So it allowed me to take a small break
  - Helped me rejoin and keep the flow

### Ideas

-   Consider creating a backlog item if the idea is something we want to implement in a future mobbing session in [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)
    for an idea (that was generated at this retro).
