Retro

Working on AI repo (not RPG repo) had us loose a lot of things [reminders, session notes].

It was more like storming.  Some like.  Some dislike.




### How did that feel?

Exhausted.  (Just talked for 1/2 the session.  Did not succeed in "bias toward action" goal.)

Didn't follow previous process
- Miro

Want to discuss changes and agree to change working agreements. (i.e. miro)

Did we agree to use miro as whiteboard (from Wody's suggestion)?

We started time box many times.  Did not hold us accountable to timer.

When we tried to capture the goal, we found that we agreed on goals (at first), but after we had task options, we requestioned the goals.

We have previous agreement to use `backlog` file.  If ideas are too big, we agree to tackle it by first breaking it to smaller sub-goals.

Discussions go on and on because
- We forgot what the goal was
- We have different ideas/approaches and want to change our mind

Elephant
I think I can demo this in 2 min
8 min later we came back after having talked about it
Michael I wanted a bias to action by doing a demo
and 
we wasted time to get the previous notes into the repo
item 1: allow the gropu to do what they want
item 2: diana prefered to take michaels code and put it into the repo
then 
diana wanted to ingest the code 
Michael told himself the 
reframe. to create value:  
diana can learn chell script

Michael declared an imagined value, but my value was to have the code in the repo and ingest it as a group doing, rather than watching
I think I could ingest it better by playing with it
I think I would not understand it well if the author was typing and talking

Agree wiuth the idea:
the demo-er should not be BOTH the talker and typer
 they do not know what the other people know or dont know

 helps if the person who is viewing demo

 the overhead it took to get to the point we could demo
 the overhead got in the way of getting demo quickly

 Ignor that for now

 JOel
 it is OK to have different oppions
 be VERY explicit on things
 on decisions

 only intentionally change the process
 no longer in the RPG repo
 I benefoit from the process that we devcleoped over time. 
 it is useful. it helps the flow of th eteam function

 adjust one thing rather than ignoring all of our typical process

 it was important to look back at our goal from last time
  that was a failed experiement
   what could we do differently

   strict about discussion time box
   sometimes we do not need everyone to agree, 
   instead just move ahead

   -> appreciate Michaels demo
   thank you for doing that
   the more code that is written that we dont see, 
   the more likely we are disoriented

   not clear about the goal and the backlog item that we are trying to solve
    the demo 

    how could the TDD process helepd?
    what is the next thing i want to do?
    what is a test that would test this
     as a usr of the tool i want to 
     write the failing tests

     John Beck
      exploratory testing
      go in and use your human intuatino to do things
       then capture what you discover

      Micheal wanted to go in and just play

      Thank you for making me feel frustrated
      maybe it is bonding exercise
      i lked joels observations
       when the mob looks like we will agree on a certain thing
       it is a good skilll to let go when you dont agree
when the majority wants to do something
  at micheal level it felt icky
at the team or team level it felt better
the team needs to learn this other thing

I liked dianas interuption to save the retro notes
 protect process
 we did it in 3 mins. 

I'm interrested in: What are we gonna do next time?
Set Goals -> Agree to Goals.

i am not sure...
we could not question goals unless we try one option 
I want people to question goals, and we dont need unanumous.

Another option for the demo would have been:
Michael talks, and someone else types for him.
Michael thinks it would have been cumbersome to move the demo to another computer
Diana thinks "how long did it take for us to get it to the shared (nitsans) repo".
Diana thinks it would have gone faster if someone was talking for michael.
In michaels perception the shift interrupted things
Diana agrees it interrupted things, but thinks it was worth it.
Diana likes Gregors description why its valuable.
Michael thought it was friction. "felt like the eyes are on me"
Diana is thankful that Michael allowed us to do it in a different way, and allowed us to do it in a different way, (with the group).

Idea: Tell our future selfs what to do next.
next week
gregor will not be here
would want

try to make suer:
have a shared env where everyonje can play and type
whenever we start talking
try the things in this env
eiasier to shift to action

Because we didnt have the env.
wortk on
contiue with what we were doing
instead of usin ghte command line
use a plain text file 
open text file to write our prompt we want to send to ChatGPT
THEN in terminal
     use one line to send the context of the text file to ChatGPT

Given this workflow, we could contiunuie working on our BingoFire (like fizzBuzz)


Assertion:  Using a text file in this (^^^^) way, it will eliminate blockers from October 5 (last week):

Diana is sorry because, she would have felt excited if she was in Michaels position

Frustrated is unable to achieve a goal you care about
- 

Problem
whomever is writing the prompt
---
when we write a prompt
make it Easy to
1 use quotes
2 enter files


Frustrated: unable to complete a goal that is important to you
we did not get to action
unable to get to action 
and
because we did not get to action 
not being able to share experience a bout what the outcome of the vision would have been

did not try to file approach
It would have felt compfortable to write prompts in this way
it would have been fun to continue with BINGO Fire in this way

Not comfortable with being uncofrotable 
is it...
can you abide in the discomfort?
can you aknowledge the discomfort and CONTUIE despite the discomfort?

Gregor- we showed how capable all of us were with being uncomfortable
we kept going and we takled the conflict and we are working on it

I held the pattern
when you talk you say a name for who is typing for me

I felt very comfortable being uncomfortable
Grateful that I was able to join late
Delighted to be here.

Today was very vulnerable



### What worked well, we want to do more of it?

### Ideas

- continue with what we were doing, instead of using the command line use a plain text file, 
    open text file to write the prompt we want to send to ChatGPT
    THEN in terminal use one line to send the content of the text file to ChatGPT

    Given this workflow, we could continue working on our BingoFire (like fizzBuzz).
    We believe using the textfile will avoid the following problems:
        when we write a prompt make it Easy to
        1. use quotes
        2. enter files


-   Consider creating a backlog item if the idea is something we want to implement in a future mobbing session in [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)
    for an idea (that was generated at this retro).
