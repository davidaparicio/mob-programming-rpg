Retro Notes go here:

### Mid-Session Retro 1 (1 minute per person - what liked/disliked & propose changes)

#### 1 minute thoughts:

 - Nitsan: 
   - liked were able to juggle a few competing ideas on how to go about refactoring
   - think maybe want to try again the other way - this time we followed the errors, could go parallel route
 - Gregor:
   - super happy got to something useful and interesting learning
   - was having a bad feeling in stomach when moving with non-compiling code
   - worked surprisingly well
   - question is - maybe sometimes it is worth it, going down the rabbit hole
   - even if maybe you fail
- David:
   - good to jump into the mob; surprizingly easy! no magic needed; good practice
   - Rabbit hole: compiler fails == tests fail; errors could be seen as a todo checklist
- Joel:
  - People speaking up about get to coding quicker
  - Good to have David! Good to have people
  - Good that we're uncomfortable with compiler errors; C# guided us through what needed to be done
  - Happy to keep going
