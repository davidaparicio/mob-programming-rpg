-   [x] **Welcome Newcomers:** If we have any newcomers review our [onboarding notes](../docs/onboarding-notes.md)
-   [ ] HH:25 **Decide on What to Code** by 25 min after the hour; choose either:

    -   [x] More code - switched to Joel's local machine to try the VS Resharper AI
        -   there's a missing test in cyber-dojo C# Tennis refactoring kata: missing test for "Deuce" vs. "Forty-All"
        -   we found that Emily fixed "Forty-All" to "Deuce" 11 years ago - https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata/commit/192bc2c15de405ea17244f07ec7c82098167d991
    -   [ ] 10m retro

Retro Notes go here:

### Mid-Session Retro 1 (1 minute per person - what liked/disliked & propose changes)

#### 1 minute thoughts:

-   Nitsan:
    -   liked were able to juggle a few competing ideas on how to go about refactoring
    -   think maybe want to try again the other way - this time we followed the errors, could go parallel route
-   Gregor:
    -   super happy got to something useful and interesting learning
    -   was having a bad feeling in stomach when moving with non-compiling code
    -   worked surprisingly well
    -   question is - maybe sometimes it is worth it, going down the rabbit hole
    -   even if maybe you fail
-   David:
    -   good to jump into the mob; surprizingly easy! no magic needed; good practice
    -   Rabbit hole: compiler fails == tests fail; errors could be seen as a todo checklist
-   Joel:
    -   People speaking up about get to coding quicker
    -   Good to have David! Good to have people
    -   Good that we're uncomfortable with compiler errors; C# guided us through what needed to be done
    -   Happy to keep going

### Mid-Session Retro 2 (1 minute per person - what liked/disliked & propose changes)

Gregor: 
Fun to learn about this Tennis Rules and the commit history of cyber-dojo and Emily's repo
Also Fun - Jetbrains are very bad at selling their AI Assitant
Thank you for today!

Joel: 
Enjoyed this a lot.
Idea: could sometimes use VSCode + Copilot
Liked: creating a failing test, and got to green quickly; but did not get to refactoring it, kept it ugly

Nitsan:
Consider creating French version of rules (see Wikipedia rules - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system), including an optional variant.
Consider trying state machines.
