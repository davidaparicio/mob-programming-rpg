# Agenda

-   [x] HH:00 **Bond:** Bonding
-   [x] **Facilitator:** Identify who facilitates
-   [ ] **Time-Keeper:** Identify who keeps track of total time for session
-   [x] **Co-Authors:** Update the [Co-Authors](#co-authors)
-   ~~[ ] **Welcome Newcomers:** If we have any newcomers review our [onboarding notes](../docs/onboarding-notes.md)~~
-   [x] HH:25 **Decide on What to Code** by 25 min after the hour; choose either:
    -   New kata: Tennis Refactoring kata in cyber-dojo using C#: - Cyber-dojo: https://cyber-dojo.org/kata/edit/0htSZJ - ChatGPT convo: https://chat.openai.com/share/a9f88e66-8e53-4c3e-8346-2eeb7c442c0d
    -   use chat GPT
-   [ ] HH:30 **Code:** Get to coding by 30 min after the hour
    -   [x] Everyone: turn on mob timer sounds ðŸ“£
    -   [x] Add "Retro" as the last participant in the timer
    -   [x] Code
    -   [x] 10m mid-session retro
    -   [x] More code
    -   [x] 10m retro
-   [ ] **Process improvement:** Improving process (e.g. the .md files)
    -   The process is defined by the [template](./session-notes-YYYY-MM-DD.md)
-   [ ] **Backlog refinement**
-   [ ] **Retro:** Final longer retro (consider: aim to start 30 min before end time)
-   [ ] Done by end of 3 hour (consider: aim to finish 10 min early)

# choosing what to do notes

simple kata

## Retro [Templates](../docs/retro-templates.md)

Retro Notes go here:

### Mid-Session Retro 1 (1 minute per person - what liked/disliked & propose changes)

-   Nitsan: thank you for practicing tennis refactoring kata. I like cyber-dojo. I prefer to stay in cyber-dojo and use GPT. Worry: different IDE will take some time/effort to get it working. I like writing the GPT prompt in its own file so we can iterate over it.

-   Diana: Noticed we weren't using GPT right away, but kept quiet to see how human refactoring would go at first. Want to continue using GPT. Neutral on moving to a different IDE.

-   Joel: agree to continue in cyberdojo, results (from GPT?) in a separate file; like: get to code quickly, limit number of changes

[x] will we sta cyber-dojo or go something other IDE?

-   Decided to stay in cyberdojo, use ChatGPT, separate file for prompts
-   consider: save the GPT-generated code in a separate file too

### Mid-Session Retro 2 (1 minute per person - what liked/disliked & propose changes)

-   [ ] still staying in cyberdojo?

Diana: Grateful for using ChatGPT
Liked putting the response back into cyberdojo
Craving using better refactoring tools; Still learned to refactor in cyberdojo
Nice timer!
https://vclock.com/timer/#countdown=00:01:00&enabled=0&seconds=0&sound=custom&loop=0

Joel: Agree. Liked the approach.
Makes sense to have the GPT results back into cyberdojo - becomes a little backlog / checklist
Payed off to not switching IDEs.
Still wonder if switching is possible? Would like to get up and running quickly

Nitsan: Cool that Joel & GPT suggested exact same 1st refactoring - spot on.
Still think we could experiment with different styles of prompts and of handing over GPT results, e.g., maybe take a small subset of what is suggested and then iterate over the prompt.

### Final Retro

-   Reschedule our sessions to be later / earlier in the day?

### How we spent our time today:

-   \_\_ minutes coding
-   \_\_ minutes template edits (?)
-   H1:00 - H0:30 bonding (30 min)
-   H1:30 - H1:55 agenda & deciding (25 min)
-   after that all coding, except just a little bit for the mid-session retros (approx. 5 min. each)
