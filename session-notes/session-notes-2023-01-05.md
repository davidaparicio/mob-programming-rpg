# Goal

- [x] For next time we could take a look at this one:
    - [x] Game ctor should use props obj iso multi params

# Retro

## How did that feel?
- Super fun
- Learned a lot
- Super Excited to have Austin +1
- Exploratory
- Very quick and smooth onboarding and getting into details
- scared of keyboard shortcuts with special keyboard on Linux machine
- Impressed by the test coverage (everytime we broke something we immediately got the feedback)

## What worked well, we want to do more of it?
- first time using GitPod - pretty seemless
- feels like we're on the verge of getting the change done
- good learning moment about props
- Lots of tidying
    - Worth it to have the code cleaned for the next time
    - Leaving it in a better state
- more - advertizing on social media, getting more people involved
- let's keep doing it - good setup, fast rotations, works smooth

## Idea
- Exploratory testing
- Tests start too fast (should wait a sec)
- Need another Service to host the wsserver
