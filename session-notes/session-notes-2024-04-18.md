## Retro [Templates](../docs/retro-templates.md)

Retro Notes go here:

### Mid-Session Retro 1 (1 minute per person - what liked/disliked & propose changes)

Kevin
- Liked the feeling. Time went quickly. Rotation gave everyone a chance. Liked tooling in a browser window, VSCode. 
- Liked working with the tests & quick & dirty DB, looked promising.
- Overall positive.

Matt
- A little nervous - a lot of people this time; previously was fewer people. Never used GitPod before, a little stressful.
- Liked - very cool to try using DB with FizzBuzz.
- Felt guilty suggesting ChatGPT, not sure if a faux pas. (Mob response: Not a problem at all; it's helpful, just up to the Talker to go along or not. Totally fine to take time on something new - or anyting. The time takes what it takes)

Nitsan
- What we're working on is less clear than usual
- When should we connect to a DB? etc.
- We just said let's do FizzBuzz and see if we can use a DB; a vaguer problem space
- Liked more people today, awesome; wish they could've stayed long

Diana
- Really fun. Like using DB for FizzBuzz.
- Did later have an opinion on which DB, but still not sure.
- Going well
- Curious about DB, like using python since team is using it

Joel
- Liked meeting Kevin and having Matt come back
- In retrospect - maybe start with requirements; let the DB be introduced using TDD
- Eager to see how it will come out
- Onboarding process - try to get to coding quickly, and use a simple problem
- Love talking Spanish with the mob!
