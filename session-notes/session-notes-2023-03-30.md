# Agenda

## Bond

-   Try a [warmup exercise](../docs/warmup-exercises.md)

## Goals

-   Check the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Reflect

### How did that feel?
????? Anyone!!!!
- Slightly awkward w/ dramatic group change
- Productive.  Made steps forward.
- Interesting.  New group dynamic.
- Stone soup.  Everyone brought something.  (i.e. inferring types)
- Went amazingly well
    - Bringing 2 new People to the group
- Happy Dance
- Learned a lot
    - How to use the UI
        - 
    - How to use the Language

### Something Surprising?
- How quickly Emily picked it up
- Liked having Gitpod to have my own view of the code without disturbing the typist
- But you have to manually open the right files when you're "Next"
- The 3 Tab setting with the mobtimer, so I could easily figure out whos in what position
- Let's just do it! Leaning in the uncomfortable, trusting the process. I found that more effective.
    - Is an advanced place to be (mature)

#### Observations & Insights
- More heterogenous.
- Decider protocol (Jim McCarthy) could help.
- Interrupt protocol is not a group norm (for this new group).
- If many people are giving typist input, it can be ????.
- Input style could be per-navigator (i.e. "I like to be directed this way or that way")
- A lot of people learned a lot of things.
- For a relatively new group, it was ???Joel-what did you say?---
- Decider Protocol could help.  And... it went well already.
- With controversial thoughts, we went deep.  Valuable learnings.  Would not have happened alone.
- Having TODO list made it very easy to pick up.
- TODO was like "bread crumbs".  Retro template -> Backlog -> GET BUSY.
- We may not have left good-enough bread crumbs for next session.
- Stopping with enough time at end of session 1 is a goodd practice for transition to session 2.


### What worked well, we want to do more of it?
- Nitsan giving recap of how we got here (accessor, Player, types, compler option, correct squigglies(or not))
- Once we bring to surface, what do we do?
- Bringing in two new people
- Emily found the Backlog immediately (The Backlog file works!)
- The benefits of improving our documentation


### Idea
-   Write your Ideas to the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)
