# Session Date: 2022-12-08
# Goal

- Fix inconsistent test failures around the wsserver
- Use the server log with snapshot testing to get good feedback on the feature
- gameref type
- Game ctor should use props obj iso multi params
- !! potential bug: rotate button should not use rotateToTarget
- !! remove old and then unused rotate functions

# Retro

## How did that feel?
- felt very welcome; got explanations needed
- felt great to work together on something!
- happy to have done it again
- excited to have Rea today, and having three people
- happy that rea joined
- suprised how quickly the onboarding was and rea could contribute
- glad we did that outside-in integration test. it felt great
- nice to invest in the environment
- smooth +2
- order of roles is confusing

- troubling - technical - when starting to drive - first need to open the recent files
- no way to "follow" in gitpod?

## What worked well, we want to do more of it?
- tackling a bug outside-in with integration test
- invest in the environment, more types, minor improvements make a big difference
- the way we rotated (timer and calling out roles, selecting of the screen)
- typist responsible of showing the timer on the "Ding"
- driver asks the talker if the Idea of the mob is 'ok'
- talker asks for help, when missing knowledge
- parallel change (first add the new behaviour, and only remove the old when its not used anymore)
- put co-authors and links in the chat

## Idea
- create a GitHub issue on gitpod - "follow" another user on https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues
- curios to test the rotation issue again manually
- automate committing WITH coauthors. for example: create a script to commit with given co-authors, and then use it all the time
    - gitpod should be able to get the co-authors from github api
