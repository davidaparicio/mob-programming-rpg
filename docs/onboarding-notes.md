# New Member Onboarding Script


Try to get to the coding part sooner (defer group business). Allow for bonding and intros.

## Have them understand what this place is

- We enjoy learning.
- It's open to everybody.
- Feel free to join and leave at any time.
- Over time we incorporated a light weight workflow.

## Welcome Kata (CyberDojo, FizzBuzz, 1 full rotation and retro)

- Brief explantion of Talker / Typer; Avoid a lot of explanations
- The goal is to have the new member see and experience the process working
- Minimize unfamiliarity
- Talker should explicitly describe what TDD step they are doing, and then reflect on what they just did. eg "as Talker, I'm going to ask for a failing test... ok, so we just ran the test and it failed as expected."

- We use [cyber-dojo](https://cyber-dojo.org/creator/home)
  - Always use [FizzBuzz](https://cyber-dojo.org/creator/choose_ltf?exercise_name=Fizz%20Buzz)
  - We should use their favourite language
- Timer rotation: 3 minutes seems best. (2 mins is ok, but tight) OR have someone sit out to make for more time.
- The new members should be at the end of the rotation
- Optional for mid-point retros: prompt the newcomer with "What went well?", "First impressions?", "Should anything change for the second part of the session?"
- Place newcomer last in the retro speaking order -> Consider have the newcomer not be first in the retro speaking order
