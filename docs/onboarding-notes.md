# New Member Onboarding Script

Try to get to the coding part sooner (defer group business). Allow for bonding and intros.

## Have them understand what this place is

- We enjoy learning.
- It's open to everybody.
- Feel free to join and leave at any time.

## Welcome Kata (CyberDojo, FizzBuzz, 1 full rotation and retro)

- Avoid a lot of upfront explanations
- The goal is to have the new member see and experience how we work
- Talker is explicit about each TDD step (eg "Let's start with a failing test...")

### Setup
- Kata Setup:
  - We use FizzBuzz on [cyber-dojo](https://cyber-dojo.org)
  - We should use their favourite language and test framework
- Timer Setup:
  - 3 minutes per turn seems best
  - New members ideally should have a chance to observe before being Talker or Typer
  - The goal is for the newcomer to experience each role in the mob and the retro

## Retro
- Consider have the newcomer not be first in the retro speaking order
- Optional for mid-point retros: prompt the newcomer with "What went well?", "First impressions?", "Should anything change for the second part of the session?"
- Prompt the newcomer with they observed had happened
