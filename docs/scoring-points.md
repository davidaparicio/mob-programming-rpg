## Potential TODOs
- Show the activities for my current Position (Typist / Talker / Mobber)
  - Typist and Talker are focused on a single Role, while Mobber could look at multiple Roles
  - Maybe - the behaviours are below the RoleSheet
  - Next - the behaviours list is expandable from the RoleSheet


## Ideas / Brainstorm
- [tldraw](https://www.tldraw.com/r/v2_c_reslV7Ord5j-z8XHwJoON?viewport=0%2C0%2C1723%2C907&page=page%3Au4vrSPRUZQQ9M9gjL8hob)
- A player can start by setting an intention (specific skill or activity) for the next rotation, then try it during the rotation, 
  and then afterward can mark if did it.
- The **mob** can set an intention (e.g. "enforce strong style pairing")
- focus: Have a view that show me only the activitites/skills for my current Roles for my Position
  - e.g. a Typer will only focus on the Typing Role
  - in other cases more than a single Role are relevant for me
- Have a complementary view that allows me to give points to the whole mob
- the view that's showing the activities and skills, can later turn into a **form**
- Play-act the game as a **lightweight** paper prototype, before investing in coding - making it concrete
- Separate the thinking about display of the information from the thinking about the gameplay
  - when we think about **how** we play the game, we do not limit ourselves to how it looks like
