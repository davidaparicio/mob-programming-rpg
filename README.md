# Mob Programming RPG

This web app automates a game developed by Willem Larsen.  See the original [Mob Programming RPG](https://github.com/willemlarsen/mobprogrammingrpg).

## Play the game

The game [is hosted here](https://gregorriegler.com/mob-programming-rpg/).  You can test it out alone, or play it with a group.

## Participate in the mobbing sessions

We use these tools to collaborate:

- [GatherTown](https://app.gather.town/app/kNtWdLSSLSYIoR5R/CodingDojo) for faces and screens. (Password: ```deliberate```)
- [mobtime](https://mobti.me/mobrpg) for role rotations.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/gregorriegler/mob-programming-rpg) as code repositiory.
- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/docs) as a shared workspace

During the sessions

* Consider opening the [Backlog](./docs/backlog.md) and following what it says, starting with Reminders at the top
* Start the game: `npm start`
* Test the game: `npm test`

## Subscribe to weekly events

This software is developed in a public remote mob where everybody is invited to join.

People often do join from all over the world.

We start at [3 pm (CET)](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=N21ubDl1a2Y4ZDFtc3AyZ2JvY2RpamtpMmtfMjAyMzAyMTZUMTQwMDAwWiA3Mzk5NWUxZTBiMWM5NDhhOGEwMDIxZWM0YzNjZTcyOTQxZjdiN2FjOTc1NGJjZTNmMGU5ZGRkMDA1MmY4NjQxQGc&tmsrc=73995e1e0b1c948a8a0021ec4c3ce72941f7b7ac9754bce3f0e9ddd0052f8641%40group.calendar.google.com&scp=ALL) every Thursday
