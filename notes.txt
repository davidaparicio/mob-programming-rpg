# Timer
- actually synchronizing the time
- notifications on timer end
- timer sound

# Settings
- make driver,navigator configurable
- timer configurable in settings
- add player button next to last player
- remove player button on each player
- drag and drop order of players

# Roles and points
- everytime you get 3 points on a level 1 role where you have a badge you can grab a level 2 point

# Usability
- when clicking earn, show the possibilities with checkboxes next to rules
- undo if wrong role selected
- grey color is not easy to see

# Tech
- cant simply stop wsserver (needs termination)
- what about clearing old localStorage
- gameId should be given as a prop to the component, the component should not read it from the url itself?
