# Timer
- notifications on timer end
- timer sound
- pause
- if you refresh in the middle of a running timer you are behind
- failed sync of timer
- given two players, after rotation add player form appears

# Settings
- make driver,navigator configurable
- remove player button on each player
- drag and drop order of players

# Roles and points
- Not sure if rotation works after full rotation
  - rotation action is triggered from all clients on end of timer
- when you complete a badge in a role, you continue and get lvl2 driver, lvl3 driver and so on, final level is jay or kent :) 
  - every new level has a new color and adjective
  - lvl2 driver will start a 'silver' bar and badge turns silver, "silver driver"
  - lvl3 could go golden for example. "great driver"
- show how many points you have on the bar
- plus and minus buttons

# Usability
- click esc to make the help disappear
- xp bar goes over edges
- warn about duplicate names
- when clicking earn, show the possibilities with checkboxes next to rules
- undo if wrong role selected
- grey color is not easy to see
- when you first open the game, can choose "create game" or "join existing game"
- disciplinarian icon missing


# Tech
- what about clearing old localStorage
